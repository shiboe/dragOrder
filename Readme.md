### A simple script for implementing a dragable ordering interface

## 	Philosophy
To provide a simplistic script for implementing draggable sorting on a list of items. 
This should should probably be expanded to utilize html 5 draggability when available. 

## 	Features
*	re-order a list of items via draggability
*       on re-ordering, give callback the new order
