### A simple script for implementing a dragable sort interface

## 	Philosophy
To provide a simplistic script for implementing draggable sorting on a list of items. This should most
certainly be converted into a jQuery plugin, and should probably be expanded to utilize html 5 draggability
when available. 

## 	Features
*	sort a list of items via draggability
